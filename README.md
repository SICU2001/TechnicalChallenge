# Technical Challenge

The Kalypso's Americas Innovation Center (AIC) is getting ready for its next opening anniversary. A system needs to be
generated to randomly distribute one gift to each one of the N current employees in Mexico.

There are 3 possible gifts:
* Backpack
* T-shirt
* Hoodie

We would like your help as an intern to generate the pseudocode to display the final list of employees and the gifts that
were assigned to them.

Here are the conditions to consider for developing the pseudocode:

1. Use any data structure (array, list, queue, stack, hashtable, tree, etcetera) to store the 3 different gifts. They
will act as a "database" that can be accessed to retrieve the information. Explain why you used that data
structure.

2. Use a cycle to display (print) a list with the number of the employee (1 to #) and the gift assigned to her/him.
3. There are only 20 hoodies available, so in case the 20 hoodies available have been already assigned, proceed
to only assign the Backpacks and T-shirts to the other employees.
